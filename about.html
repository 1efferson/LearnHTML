  <h2>My Journey</h2>
  <p>
    I attended the University of Cape Coast, where I began exploring my interest in technology and development. Since then, I've been honing my skills through personal projects, collaboration, and continuous learning in the ever-evolving world of software development.

  <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
  <p>
    I believe in consistent growth and the power of persistence. My approach to development is grounded in the mindset of <em><strong>"progress over perfection"</strong> </em>— always learning, improving, and pushing boundaries one step at a time.
